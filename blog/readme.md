# Blog posts about Jackal

Posts made to [my development blog](jordankaye.dev) about Jackal are copied here so that they can easily be read/associated with the source code at the time
the post was written. Each post is roughly aligned with the completion of one of the development stripes (described in more detail in [the blog introduction](./intro.md)).

These posts are not directly published to any site from here; this is a read-only copy. To provide feedback about these posts, please see [the Organizing Chaos repository](https://github.com/jkaye2012/blog-hugo)
